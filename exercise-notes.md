### Overall Excercise Reminders
- Open with a basic opening/introductions and set basic expectations
- Define simple wrap up/closeout at the end of the exercise prior to opening 15 min presentation

### Sprint Reminders
- Prioritize Story Pointing
- Don't forget to mention 508 considerations when discussing stories
- Don't skip over A/C Review
- Engage Stakeholders for prioritization of stories
- Clarify the pointing system
  - 2 points = 1/2 Sprint
  - 3 points = 1 Sprint
  - 5 points = 2+ Sprints
- Lets have Matt Copher be in charge of moving the stories in Zenhub board between statuses

### Design Studio 
- Limit pairing to 3: Dom, Danielle, Aubrey each paired with a VA Stakeholder.  If only 3 stakeholders available, then pair Matt Copher with Dom?
- Handling a non-decisive resolution to the studio

  “If this was our true design studio approach, we would continue working and iterating together
 until we uncovered more insights and worked through our ideas, questions, and concerns to come to greater consensus around an approach. In this compressed session, however, our goal is to demonstrate the process and we’ll now go back and synthesize the results
 quickly to help move the process along to the next phase. We’ll give added weight to user and SME feedback, and will bring our in-progress solution back to you for more feedback, user testing, and refinement in the following sprints.”

### Stakeholder Engagement
- Clearly outline who the stakeholder POC's will be in each Sprint to ensure we don't duplicate or pre-empt each other

### Highlighting Personalization
- Personalization is an important aspect for the VA
- Even if we can't build it, we should have stories to account for it
- Examples:
  - Prefill of any applications/forms/wizards if user is signed in
  - Benefit recommendations:
    - experience in signed-in state (ie, should we consider serving up the new tool/wizard to specific signed-in users...quick example using today’s scenario might be that, based on user’s birthdate and disability rating, we might serve up a link to the “Can I get
    - a pension before I’m 65 years old?” tool when the user reaches 55 years)
  - Ability to tell the user why they didn’t qualify and/or if more info is needed for an application in signed-in state (like we just completed for the health care application for Dragons team where we developed dynamic, segmented messaging for different scenarios)

### SEO & Analytics
- Make sure we highlight consideration for SEO in the story backlog
- Engage the stakeholders for information and consideration on analytics

### Aiming for an MVP
- Don’t bite off more than we can chew for the dev deliverable. 
- Propose what we think is, overall, the best MVP solution and then take a few minutes at the start of Sprint 2 to have the devs break it down into our “MVP of the MVP”.  
- Using Friday's scenario:
**MVP:**
  - Alert component on one page
  - Functional wizard (1-2 screens; not actual content/flow)
  - Full wizard flow and final; content documented in markdown file and Invision prototype
**Ideal:**
  - Functional alert component; on all relevant pages, linking to wizard
  - Functional wizard with full; flow and actual content

### Handling Internal Deliverables
- Identify for each story who the team member is that will receive the story's output (eg: Dev who needs the wireframe)
- Focus on simplyifing the Design -> Dev flow so that we aren't tripping over each

### Minimum Developer Guidelines
- **Follow the Style Guide for even basic/MVP components**
- Capture plain language error messaging for good user feedback
- Ensure we include basic 

### Testing
- Complete a test-plan.md to be added to Github
- Upload all test scripts as md files in Github
- Ensure we have unit tests
- Run unit tests and manual test cases by the end of each sprint

### Launch Documentation and Guidance
- We're building a user-guide.md to capture this in limited capacity given our timelines
- Focus on Sprint 3 beginning to close this out (Task to Matt Copher?)
